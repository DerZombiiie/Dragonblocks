	<h3>History</h3>
	<h4>1.0</h4>
	<span>It all begun at 01.01.2019, when I [Fleckenstein] decidet to do a new Eligame.I wanted to make it a Jumping Game in which you need to jump down from the top,a little bit like Doodle Jump, just inverted.For it were christmas holidays, i time for coding the whole day and after three days i was finished. The Engine was done (through it had many bugs) and so was the first level. But in these time programming style, seperation of engine and game et cetera were unknown words for me. I couldn't find a way throu my own code. I stopped the Project.</span>
	<h4>2.0</h4>
	<span>But the story continues: Surprisingly exactly three months after the start of it all, at the 01.03.2019, In the easter holidays. I spent the previous week with hard gaming. 10 hours a day i was playing on ctf.rubenwardy.com, a Capture the Flag Minetest Server (So dont think programmers are hobbyless nerds that dont know the fun in gaming). But after six days it kinda got too boring. So i started to code. My plan was a redo of my project from three months ago, but this time with a better concept: 2D voxel. I named the Engine and the Game Gravity, because that's what was the most difficult of the whole project: the physics Engine. Then I fell in some kind of trance, i could only think in JavaScript anymore. After three days the goal was actually reached. Then School started again and there was no time for coding (or gaming) anymore.</span>
	<br><br>
	<center><img src="Menu/gravity1.png" width=300></center>
	<h4>2.1</h4>
	<span>The one who made me contine the project was my Friend DerZombiiie. He liked the project because he is a big minecraft fan himself and we started working on the version 2.1. I brought my laptop to school everyday and In the breaks me, DerZombiiie and SC sat on a couch in the school libary, developing. In most times I brought some sheets that were filled with Code. I wrote them in class (because the ninth grade is seriously useless, you dont learn ANYTHING). It were really nice times back then and then Engine was growing and getting better. I named the Game Dragonblocks and the my style was getting better slowly. I was quite proud when the development was over, and I had many Ideas how to improve then Game further.</span>
	<br><br>
	<center><img src="Menu/gravity2.png" width=300></center>
	<h4>2.2</h4>
	<span>The development of Dragonblocks 2.2 started on the day 2.1 was finished. The biggest goals were to make jumping and building possible. Also I refactored the Engine completely because there were many things that were ... well, big shit. I already noticed a lot of them during 2.1 but I always thought : Let's do it later. I also added a Options Menu, through it was quite minimalistic. I decided to stop bringing my Laptop to School because People mostly thoght I was gaming or something and found it strange. But there were PC Workstations in the School Libary and I also developed in Informatic Class. We were learning about sqlite3 Databases. Sqlite can be very useful if you connect it with php or lua or something, but JUST sqlite is useless and boring. I already knew sqlite, so I was doing something else most times. My classmates didn't, but they were doing something else, too, because they didn't care about informatic at all. Another difference was that while I was programming they were gaming or watching pornos(!) or looking for cute monkey pictures while throwing their buggers at each other. My Informatic Teacher, ablion, hated my class and i totally agree with him. So this year of Informatic was a lot of fun for me and no fun for my Classmates because anyone to misbehave got a bad grade. And Ablion... well, lets say each informatic lesson he got about 50 new pages to add to the school firewall. <br>Another big part of Dragonblocks 2.2 was made on the Workstations in the School Libary. But again there were fools messing it. There were 5 Workstations and if you wanted to get one at the start of the break you had to hurry. On one PC I was developing Dragonblocks. Sometimes DerZombiiie also got one and developed parts of the game. On all the other PCs there were kids watching funny cat videos or playing online games or something. Many were playing Cookieclicker. And they got more every break. One day there were 30 people staring at the screens, pushing each other and the libary turned form the quietest place of the school into the loudest. Sometimes they took my USB Stick and didn't give it back till we told a teacher. But then the teachers denied ANY activities on the Workstations but research. And any but research includes coding. So we got banned from the Workstations, through we were the only ones to use them for usefull things. I never put my foot into the libary again. That's when DerZombiiie and I founded Elidragon. The development of Dragonblocks 2.2 was finished at the 14th of June.</span>
	<br><br>
	<center><img src="Menu/gravity3.png" width=300></center>
	<h4>2.3</h4>
	<span>After 2.2 i started 3.0 because the Gravity3 Engine had many corners that were junk, lots of leftover code that had no use anymore and still a bad style. But during the development of 3.0 I decidet thought i could do an 2.2.1 to make 2.2 more playable. But that got a bigger project so I named it 2.3.</span>
	<br><br>
	<center><img src="Menu/gravity4.png" width=300></center>
	<h4>3.0</h4>
	<span>Coming Soon or maybe not so Soon... The development probably wont be finished before 2020, but we're working really hard on it.</span>
